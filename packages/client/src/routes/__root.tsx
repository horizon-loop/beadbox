// Root layout for the Beadbox SPA.
//
// Layering (outside-in):
//   1. PostHogProvider — analytics init (gated by getAnalyticsEnabled()),
//      no-op when VITE_POSTHOG_KEY is unset. Wraps everything so capture()
//      calls from any descendant succeed.
//   2. WorkspaceRailPanel — persistent, resizable left rail of workspace
//      tabs (+ dashboard / add / remove). Sibling of the gate, not a
//      child: it must stay mounted while the gate re-checks health on a
//      workspace switch. Hidden below 768px.
//   3. StartupGate — workspace registry health, version checks, redirect
//      to /workspaces when no_registry. Renders error screens INSTEAD of
//      children when health fails, so per-route Header mounts (inside
//      <Outlet />) are structurally inside StartupGate and get replaced
//      by the gate's error UI.
//   4. <Outlet /> — TanStack Router renders the active route here. Per-
//      route components mount their own Header (the chrome is in
//      packages/client/src/components/header.tsx, available to import).
//   5. Toaster + DevBadge — chrome that always renders regardless of route
//      or gate state. window.bd() helper is installed at module-load in
//      main.tsx (bb-tu1m removed the prior console-logo.tsx planter along
//      with the BEADBX ASCII + bd-help-tip dev-console noise).
//
// P2.4 mounts the dual-channel change subscription here. SINGLE SOURCE
// per arch §5: P3.[2-6] consume invalidations via TanStack Query —
// they never mount their own subscription. The active workspacePath
// comes from StartupGate's WorkspaceGateContext (resolved during the
// startup health check). useChangeSubscription must be inside the
// gate's React tree so the context lookup succeeds; we use a thin
// internal component for the same reason.
//
// The <html> shell + theme className live in packages/client/index.html.
// This component renders inside <body> via main.tsx's <RouterProvider>.

// Centralized change-subscription mount. Lives inside StartupGate so it
// can read the active workspace from WorkspaceGateContext. The hook is a
// no-op when workspacePath is null (no active workspace yet) or when
// we're not running under Tauri (browser dev iteration).
//
// bb-fvw2: derive activePath from the cookie-active workspace, not from
// `workspaces[0]`. Two bugs collapsed by this:
//   1. Wrong-workspace subscription — bd's getWorkspaces() returns
//      registry order, not active order; subscribing to workspaces[0]
//      means change events fire for the wrong db while the user views
//      another. No live updates for the actually-active workspace.
//   2. Subscribe.start churn — getWorkspaces() ordering is not stable
//      across calls (see [ws:resolve] in beadbox-sidecar.log). Any
//      non-deterministic shuffle flips workspaces[0], flips activePath,
//      and re-fires useChangeSubscription. Each restart spawns a new
//      change-detector + Dolt pool + initial-change emit, queueing
//      kkrpc traffic and starving in-flight handler responses (this is
//      the home-page bead-list stall vector).
// Cookie is the source of truth for "active workspace"; fall back to
// workspaces[0] only when no cookie is set (first launch before any
// /workspaces selection).
//
// bb-onv3.2: also re-resolve on workspace-cookie change. workspaces array
// reference doesn't change when the user picks a different active workspace
// (same registered set, just different selection), so without this
// subscription the effect would never re-fire on a switch — the
// change-detector would stay pinned to whichever workspace was resolved
// first. subscribeWorkspaceCookie pubs from setWorkspaceCookie /
// clearWorkspaceCookie on a module-scoped EventTarget (workspace-cookie.ts).
