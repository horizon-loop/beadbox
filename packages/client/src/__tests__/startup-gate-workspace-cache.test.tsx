// StartupGate — per-workspace startup cache.
//
// Switching projects used to re-run the startup health check every time,
// which unmounts the gate's children and flashes "Starting up...". The
// gate now remembers which workspaces passed a check this session and
// adopts a switch back to one of them silently: no extra
// runStartupHealth call, children never unmount.
//
// The gate reads router state, so it mounts inside a memory router.
